<img src="https://www.teahub.io/photos/full/136-1360297_jai-shree-ram-wallpaper-hd-x-rh-bbwallpaper.jpg" width="400"> <p>Jai Shri Ram (IAST: Jaya Śrī Rāma) is an expression in Indic languages, translating as "Glory to Lord Rama" or "Victory to Lord Rama". The proclamation has been used by Hindus as an informal greeting, as a symbol of adhering to Hindu faith, or for projection of varied faith-centered emotions.

    The expression was used by the Indian Hindu nationalist organisations Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP), Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and their allies, which embraced the slogan in the late 20th century as a tool of increasing the visibility of Hinduism in public spaces and went on to use it as a battle cry. The slogan has since then been employed for perpetration of communal violence against people of other faiths.
